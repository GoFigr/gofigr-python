Compatibility
================

GoFigr requires Python 3.7 or later, and works with both the Jupyter Notebook (including upcoming Jupyter 7) and Jupyter Lab.

The GoFigr Jupyter extension has been tested with:

* ``python >= 3.7.16``
* ``notebook >= 6.5.4``
* ``jupyterlab >= 3.6.3``
* ``matplotlib >= 3.5.3``
* ``ipython >= 7.34.0``

Library support
********************

At the moment, GoFigr works with matplotlib and matplotlib-based libraries like seaborn. However, the service itself
should work with any plotting library which can produce an image.
We welcome patches which add support for new libraries at https://github.com/GoFigr/gofigr-python.
