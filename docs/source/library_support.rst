Compatibility
================

GoFigr requires Python 3.7 or later.

The GoFigr Jupyter extension has been tested with:

* ``matplotlib``
* ``seaborn``

However, the service itself should work with any plotting library which
can produce an image. We welcome patches which add support for new libraries at https://github.com/GoFigr/gofigr-python.
